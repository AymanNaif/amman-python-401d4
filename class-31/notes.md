# REST Framework and Docker

## REST: REpresentatinal State Stransfer
- Methods or rules to transfer data between servers (or server/client)
- 


### node.js
- Templates to render data from backend (backend rendering)
- Similar to Django templates

### django
- Templating in Django
- We are heading to the idea or seperating backend from frontend
    - In Django, we will build APIs only. No html templates. (Server side data)
    - In any other frontend framework (such as ReactJS, vue.js, AngularJS, JQuery), we will cunsume data coming from Django into pages on the web (Client side rendering)
- Why?
     - Freedom in frontend
     - Seperation of concerns
        - If we build a service in Django, we can use ANY frontend framwork to talk to the service 

- How?
     - REST
